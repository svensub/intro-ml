## Introduction to Machine Learning Assessment

The repository contains code that applies two machine-learning classification methods to analyse single-cell RNA-seq data and extract discriminative features: random forests and support vector machines (SVMs). The associated R Markdown document with commented code used for the analysis can be found under the intro_ml.Rmd file. The primary package used for classification was the caret R package (https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v028i05). The code covers data wrangling, pre-processing, testing and training models.
